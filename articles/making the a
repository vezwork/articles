Making The Î±.

<p>
    Hey! whats going on everybody? this is my best friend <b>Todd.</b> <b>Todd</b> has never been out of his house but sometimes he 
    looks at images of the insides of other peoples homes online. 
    Keep on keepin on <b>Todd!</b> You do you, no matter what anyone else says.

<code>header = document.getElementsByTagName("header")[0];

window.onscroll = <i style="color:tomato;">function</i>(){
    <i style="color:tomato;">if</i> (document.body.scrollTop > 50) {
        header.style.position = "absolute";
    } <i style="color:tomato;">else</i> {
        header.style.position = "relative";
    }
};</code>
</br>
    Never tell Todd what to do or he gets angry! Sometimes if you don't do exactly what Todd asks you to do he brings out the chinese dragon and I don't like it when that happens.

    This is a new person, his name is <b>Francis Durnharvey</b> and he has raided the columns for everything they're worth. 
    Never underestimate a man with nothing to lose, and never overestimate a man with nothing to gain.
    Check out this new website: <a href="google">Google!</a> Now I have to write a few more things to see if this displays the way I want it to!
