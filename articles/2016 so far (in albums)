2016 So Far (In Albums)

<p>
Welcome to the list of the <b>albums I've listened to this year!</b> 
I thought I would start keeping track of the albums I listened to so I can come back to the good ones.
I also started rating Albums released this year in order to keep a running tally leading up to the end of the year when I'll decide on my albums of the year.
I'll update this article as I go. 
<br><br>
I hope you can <b>find something you like</b> in here :)

--- Legend ---
★★★★★ - Album of the year candidate (I loved it).
★★★★   - Worth listening to again, and probably have and will.
★★★     - Enjoyable to listen to, but I probably won't return to it.
★★       - Wasn't enjoyable to listen to.
★         - Not sure why I listened to the full album if it's this bad.
(no stars) - Album wasn't released this year, but is grouped with an artist who released an album this year.
